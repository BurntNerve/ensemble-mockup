            <p class="body">Once you join Ensemble, you'll be able to choose from 6 different factions: Actor, Director, Designer, Crew, Producer, and Writer. When you've created a project page you can proceed to search for people based on which faction you need. Does
              your project require only a few actors but quite a lot of designers? Search within your community and find out who's nearby.</p>

            <h1 class="title is-blue">Projects</h1>
            <p class="body">Projects are the real purpose for joining Ensemble. You can begin by creating a profile page for your project and reaching out to members of your community who you think would be a good fit. You can then set a schedule and begin the rehearsal
              process. Once you've started rehearsals, Directors can post notes for every night on your project page and reach out to individual actors.

            <p class="body">Eventually you'll come up with an idea for a project so enormous you'll require some funds that you don't have. This is where funding comes into play. Seek out producers in your area to explain your project to and try to inspire some interest.
              If you get some on board they can donate to your project right from it's profile and they'll be listed as a producer for that project.
